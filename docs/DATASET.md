During TTT, we use Objaverse objects that is share similar CLIP feature with the in-the-wild object as 'super-class' regularization objects. You need to get them from google drive(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1usCRP4Cw0VRGnrOJ3ggHX4vRnWdLcld1/view?usp=sharing), decompress them and place them here : `dataset/data/objaverse`  -->

### Using Objaverse Objects with TTT
During the Test Time Training(TTT) process, we utilize Objaverse objects. These objects share similar CLIP features with 'in-the-wild' objects and serve as 'super-class' regularization objects.

#### Obtaining Objaverse Objects
1. Download the Objaverse objects from Google Drive: [Download Objaverse Objects](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1usCRP4Cw0VRGnrOJ3ggHX4vRnWdLcld1/view?usp=sharing).
2. Decompress the downloaded file.
3. Place the decompressed files in the following directory: `dataset/data/objaverse`.
